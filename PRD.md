Project Title: Total News – News That Fits Your World
Goal:
Total News is a streamlined, category-based news platform that delivers clear, relevant stories across a range of topics without overwhelming the reader.

Core Features:

- Users can browse current articles sorted into five categories: World, Tech, Culture, Science, and Local.
- Each article includes a title, author/date, and written content (short articles).
- Category pages show a list or grid of article previews (image + headline + short summary).
- A homepage “Trending” section highlights the most-read or recently updated stories.
- A simple form allows users to submit news tips or local stories for consideration.

Planned Pages:

- Homepage: Overview with featured articles and quick links to each category.
- Organized News Page: Categories with links to articles
- About: Explains the purpose of the website, sourcing, and editorial values.
- Submit Tip: Basic contact form for readers to share tips or local updates.

Design/Interaction Notes:
The layout should be clean and easy to navigate with a focus on legibility and content flow.
Each category will have a subtle color tag for fast visual sorting.
There will be no user accounts, comments, or advanced interactivity; just a smooth, content focused
reading experience that adapts well to mobile.

Homepage wireframe instructions:

- Footer with some basic information (can be made up) about the news company (address, location,
  and copyright tag)
- Articles don't have to be real, just filler words are fine, same goes with author names and the
publishing date

Category wireframe instructions: 

- Design of the page is up to you but each category must be clearly named, include a relevant image, and have links to articles in that category
- Categories are World, Tech, Culture, Science, and Local
